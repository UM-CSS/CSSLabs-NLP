    "- In this lab, we'll learn about topic modeling. Topic modeling uses statistics to understand what text is about, that is, to find the topics in text.\n",
    "- We'll use the online dating profile text that OKCupid made public as our example, but of course topic modeling can be used on any text.\n",

    "    - $ x^2+3x+2 $ can be factored as $ (x+2)(x+1)$\n",
    "- When we convert the text into numbers for the computer, it gets stored as something called a `matrix`.\n",
    "    - The matrix is `non-negative` because we can't have negative numbers of words: all the word counts are zero or more.\n",
    "- It is not important right now how exactly we find factors for these matrices, but if you're curious, you can learn more about it in a Linear Algebra class.\n",
    "- It turns out that finding factors for text is a really good way of finding topics. This makes sense intuitively: factors are simple things we can combine to get the more complicated output, and topics are simple things people combine to write profiles.\n",

    "    - Inverse document frequency means we divide (\"inverse\") by the number of documents the word is in. (If everyone uses the word, it isn't very helpful for figuring out what makes people different. So this measurement looks for words that are used a lot in some documents, and not at all in others.)"
