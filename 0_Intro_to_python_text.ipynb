    "### 1.1 Imports\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is import the tools we will be using.\n",
    "- Pandas is a \"package\" that contains python tools (in programming terms: \"functions\" and \"data structures\") for working with data. We'll see some of these tools in action in this lab. \n",
    "- The first part of the first line, `import pandas`, does exactly what it says. It brings the pandas tools into our current notebook so that we can use them.\n",
    "- The second part, `as pd`, lets us refer to pandas by typing `pd` instead of `pandas`. This shortcut is not required, but it is very common and popular. Programmers often like to cut down on typing by making names very short. \n",
    "- When you run this code, it will import pandas, but it won't show us any output (unless there is an error), because we have not asked it to show us any output. Computers are very literal: they do exactly and only what we tell them to.\n",
    "- There are several ways to run the code in a \"cell\" (those grey boxes with code in them). First, click anywhere inside the cell. Then you can either click the ▶ button near the top left of the page, or you can press [shift]+[enter] to run that cell and jump to the next one. \n",
    "    - Before a cell has been run, it will say `In [ ]:` on the left, indicating that this is a cell where you **in**put code.\n",
    "    - While the code in a cell is running, that is, when the computer is doing what the code tells it to, it will say `In [*]:` on the left.\n",
    "    - After the code in a cell has finished running, it will say something like `In [1]:` or `In [2]:`. The number is the order in which that code ran. So 1 was run first, then 2, and so on. If you run a cell a second time, its number will update to the latest number. \n",
    "    - If the code produces some output for the user to see, below the cell a new box will be created and labeled `Out [x]:`, where `x` is the number of the input cell that generated it. "

    "- The way we get to functions within a package is by using the period, like this `pd.read_csv()`. That tells python \"go to `pd` (which we said earlier is short for `pandas`) and look inside it for something called `read_csv`.\"\n",
    "- `read_csv` needs to know *which* csv file we want to read. So we tell it we want the one in the `data` folder (aka directory) named `profiles.csv.zip` by typing `'data/profiles.csv.zip'` into the round brackets of `read_csv()`. All functions have round brackets, even if we don't have any information to give them. \n",
    "- Finally, we need to make a name for the data we just read, so that we can ask python to do things with it. I'll be simple and name it \"profiles\", but you could name it anything (including \"my_data\", \"geraffe\", \"anything\", etc.). It is good to pick descriptive names, so that you can easily remember what data the names refer to. \n",
    "- In programming, named data is called a \"variable,\" and in order to associate a variable / name with data, we \"assign\" the data to the variable by setting the variable (on the left) equal to the data (on the right). \n",

(It \"varies\" because we could change the data associated with the name/variable.) In statistics, it often means information that we collect, such as age or income. More on this in a moment. \n",

Another way to think about the difference is that with round brackets you're giving information ('arguments') to a function, while with square brackets you're asking for some of the information from inside a variable.\n",

Together, `\\` and `n` represent the invisible \"new line\" character. They tell python that we want a new line, the same as pressing [enter] on your keyboard starts a new line in an essay. Because we're programming what is in the text and computers are very literal, we want to see these otherwise invisible characters so we can specify exactly what we want and where.

    "    - At the end of this first line, we place a colon `:` to tell python that the code after this belongs inside the function. \n",
    "    - The lines after this are indented (the notebook should auto-indent for us) so that python knows they are within the function definition above them. If you have programmed in other languages before, this is probably different than you are used to. Python is a \"whitespace language\", which means that it uses the indentation of code to tell if it is part of a function. \n",
    "    - The next two lines are the same code as before: the function takes whatever string it will be given, calls it `text`, splits it into a list of words `w`, and measures the length of that list (counts the number of words) as `l`.\n",
    "    - The 4th line uses the keyword `return` to tell python that this function will give some information back when we use it. Here, we're giving back the word count.\n",
    "    - Functions \"return\" when they are done running. At that point, the computer \"returns\" to whichever part of the code was running before the function's name was called, and it brings back whatever the output (\"return value\") of the function was.  Code after this is not part of the function, and so it is not indented.\n",
    "- We use our new function just like we used other functions:\n",
    "    - We call our `word_count()` function, giving it the same string `t` as before, and save its output in the variable `n_words`. (Note that `t` is the name of the variable we gave to the function, and it can be different than `text`, which is what the function has nicknamed that variable internally.)\n",

    "    - We can see the error happened in our `word_count` function.\n",
    "    - It happened with the line `w = text.split()`.\n",
    "- Thus, the `text` we gave to our function must be something called a `float`, and a `float` must not work with the `split()` function. \n",
    "- If you encountered an error like this on your own, this would be a good time to paste the last line of the error into google and see how other people have solved it. Because this is a lab, we explain it here:\n",
    "    - `float` is a programming word for a number. It's actually short for \"floating point number,\" because floats can have decimal points in them. E.g. `3.14` is a `float`.\n",
    "    - Because `float`s are numbers and not `string`s, we can't do the same things with them. For instance, it makes sense to multiply two numbers, but multiplying text would be silly. Here, the error is complaining because we tried to use the string function `split` on a number, and splitting a number into words doesn't make sense. \n",
